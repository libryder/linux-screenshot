Linux screenshot utility written in bash. Arguably, according 
to purists, this is not a bash script because of the non-bash 
dependencies used such as scrot, xclip, etc. 

For this reason, I would be open to make this into a 
Ruby/Python executable with assistance. As is, this utility 
serves its purpose well. 

Setup is easy:

1) Extract files into directory and in a terminal, cd into it
2) In the same terminal, run

	chmod +x ssc ssc.cfg

3) Open ssc.cfg and make any modifications. By default, ssc will 
   upload to imageshack  and save screenshots to ~/.screenshot
4) Run ssc from the the CLI with ./ssc or create a custom launcher 
   with the following command:
	
	bash -c "/path/to/ssc/ssc" &

This runs bash as a daemon (and exits when upload is complete) so 
you never have to see the terminal. 

Would love to see any modifications or suggestions!
